DataCamp Case Study: Analyzing Marketing Campaigns with pandas

# Project Description
We'll practice translating common business questions into measurable outcomes, including "How did this campaign perform?", "Which channel is referring the most subscribers?", "Why is a particular channel underperforming?" and more using a fake marketing dataset based on the data of an online subscription business.
This project will build on Python and pandas fundamentals, such as merging/slicing datasets, groupby(), correcting data types and visualizing results using matplotlib.

## Analysis consisted of following activities (in sequence)
1. Visualizing daily marketing reach
2. Calculating conversion rate and retention rate
3. Visualizing daily conversion rate
4. Understanding marketing performance across various channels for cohorts of age groups
5. Analyzing retention rates for the campaign
6. Building functions to automate analysis
7. Identifying and resolving inconsistencies
8. Assessing bug impact
9. Personalisation of A/B test

- Test allocation
- Calculating list and significance testing
- Evaluating using t-test using 'stats.ttest_ind' from the scipy library
- Building and testing of A/B test segmenting function
